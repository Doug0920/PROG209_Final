		<h3>How to play:</h3>
		<p>Use the arrow keys to move your orange player up, down, left, or right. All buildings can only be entered from the South (from directly below their square). Luckily, the monster follows the same rules, and it cannot enter the Hospital. The monster moves after after your move.</p>
		<p>Object of the game is to reach the goal (blue flag) before the monster reaches (and eats) you!</p>
